Assignment

Consider the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/single-chestmounted-accelerometer

It contains accellerometer timeseries for 15 participants performing 7 different physical activities.

For this assignement focus on a single participant (of your choice) and study its 7 different activities using the Continous Wavelet Decomposition (CWD) approach discussed during the lectures. It suffices to compare the CWD visually and report you considerations on similarities and differences between the activities.

Note: you need to run the CDW separately for each accelerator channel. You can choose the wavelet family you prefer more (at random is also ok). In Python you may want to use Pywavelets or in Matlab the bundled Wavelet Toolbox (or you can use any other language and library that makes sense to you, but for this assignment I strongly advise Matlab).
