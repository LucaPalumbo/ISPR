DATASET (HORSES): www.kaggle.com/datasets/ztaihong/weizmann-horse-database/data

Implement your own convolutional network to solve problem of horse semantic segmentation from the background in the Horses Dataset. Choose your favourite convolutional-type architecture to solve the problem and motivate your choice. The design decisions about how many layers, the type of layers and how they are interleaved, the type of pooling, the use of residual connections, etc. are also on you.  Train and validate the model on the data as appropriate in Machine Learning an provide a measure of segmentation accuracy.
